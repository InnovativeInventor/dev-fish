## Requirements
- [Omf](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)/[Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)/[MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim)
- [Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances)

## Install
Once this is in one of your omf package repositories, run: 

```fish
$ omf repositories add https://github.com/InnovativeInventor/fish-personal master
$ omf install dev-fish
```

## Usage
Use your command line just like normal (and revel in the better `ls`, `find`, `top`, and vim)

## Aliasing Philosophy
The reason why this project overwrites/overaliases common linux utilities like `top` or `ls` is so that there is never a time when you type in `top` into a machine and *nothing* pops up.

It's hard to break habits, so getting used to using something like `glances` or `exa` and accidentally trying to run those programs on a different machine can get annoying. 
By overwriting/overaliasing common linux utilities, you only have one command to memorize and it'll never fail you.
